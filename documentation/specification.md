# Annotation modulable interface

1. Definition of the annotation modulable interface

	This interface will be an annotation interface of multimedia contents (audio, video, textâ€¦), but with the specificity to be modulable, modules will be available and future developers will just have to implement the main structure and import modules according to their needs.
	The main specification will be that the modules can synchronize with each other can interact with the server. We want to keep a collaborative aspect, this means that data are shared, modifications included, and make the whole application responsive.
	The architecture will be a classical MVC (Model-View-Controller), and the purpose of the project is to use frameworks for each module and made them work together.


2. Modules

	This is an exhaustive list of the different modules that will have to be implemented.

		- Play/Pause
		- Volume control

	9. Labelling parser
	
		Fusion of the segmenter and the labelling window.
		Segmenter display with the new option: annotate segments
