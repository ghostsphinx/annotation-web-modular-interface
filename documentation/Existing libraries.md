Existing libraries:

	amalia.js:
		HTML5 video player
		many plugins (controls, timeline, text sync, overlay, editor...)

		The player can do many things, but most of them are not useful, we have to keep it as simple as possible if we only want a video player.

	peaks.js:
		Waveform displayer and controller
		need to convert audio file to waveform file with a C++ software

		For our use, it is unsuable since we can't have waveform files.
		EDIT: Waveform files are not necessary anymore.

	wavesurfer.js:
		Simple waveform from HTLM5 audio

		It's simple, it has few functions, it is a module that we can use.

	wave.js:
		Only theory, no code.

	waves.js:
		It has more functions than wavesurfer, so we end up with a problem similar as amalia, with less proportions.

	timeside:
		It is in Python.
